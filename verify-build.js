/**
 * Build Verification Notes
 * ========================
 * 
 * 3D Model Upload Functionality:
 * ------------------------------
 * - When a user uploads a glTF/GLB file, it DOES create a project in the database
 * - The current UI has separate sections for "Floor Plan Upload" and "3D Model Upload (Optional)"
 * 
 * Suggested Improvements:
 * 1. Clarify in the UI that uploading either a floor plan OR a 3D model creates a project
 * 2. Consider updating the label from "3D Model Upload (Optional)" to "Upload 3D Model"
 *    and add text explaining "You can create a project with either a floor plan or a 3D model"
 * 3. Consider having a single upload section with two buttons:
 *    - "Upload Floor Plan" (primary button)
 *    - "Upload 3D Model" (secondary button)
 * 
 * Database Storage:
 * ----------------
 * - Floor plans are stored in Firebase Storage under: floorplans/{userId}/{timestamp}_{filename}
 * - 3D models are stored under: models/{userId}/{projectId}/{timestamp}_{filename}
 * - Project metadata is stored in Firestore in the "projects" collection
 * - Each project document includes:
 *   * name
 *   * previewUrl
 *   * originalImageUrl 
 *   * modelUrl (if a 3D model was uploaded)
 *   * userId
 *   * createdAt timestamp
